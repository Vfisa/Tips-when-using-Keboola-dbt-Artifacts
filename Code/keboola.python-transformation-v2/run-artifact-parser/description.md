This configuration defines a data pipeline with three main blocks: File Validation, Parser, and Model Timing. 

1. **File Validation Block**: 
   - Contains a code snippet to list files in a specified directory.
   
2. **Parser Block**:
   - Contains a code snippet to parse a log file and extract relevant data into a CSV file.
   - Defines functions to process the log entries and extract specific data fields.
   - Creates a CSV file and writes the extracted data into it.
   
3. **Model Timing Block**:
   - Contains a code snippet to process a model timing JSON file and calculate the duration of each model run.
   - Opens a CSV file for writing and writes the processed data into it.

The configuration also specifies the input files required for processing (run_results.json, manifest.json, model_timing.json, dbt.log) and the output tables where the processed data will be stored (out.c-artifact-parser.dbt_log, out.c-artifact-parser.model_timing). The output tables are set to be incremental with specific primary keys for data management.
